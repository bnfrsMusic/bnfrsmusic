## Hello There, I am Ayush Sahoo! ðŸ‘‹
I am a Computer Engineering Student at Mercer University. I am currently working on several research projects, especially those involving machine learning and computer vision. This includes, but is not limited to MLRust, a (WIP) machine learning library built in Rust.
